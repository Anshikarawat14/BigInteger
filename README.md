# BigInteger
This project implements arithmetic operations for extremely large integers that exceed standard data type limits. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder calculations using a custom data structure. The project demonstrates efficient handling of large numbers through dynamic memory allocation and linked list representations, ensuring accuracy and scalability for computational tasks.

                                                   Key Features of Project🌟
- Addition of Big Integers ➕:

Handles addition of integers exceeding standard data types, efficiently processing large numbers by storing each digit in a linked list node.
- Subtraction of Large Numbers ➖:

Supports subtraction for numbers of varying lengths, managing borrowing automatically during the operation.
- Multiplication of Big Numbers ✖️:

Implements multiplication for arbitrary-sized integers using a digit-by-digit approach, with carry management.
- Division & Remainder Calculation ➗🔄:

Performs division with high precision, returning both the quotient and remainder. Handles large divisors and supports modular arithmetic operations.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation 🧠:

Uses malloc() for efficient handling of memory as the size of numbers grows, adjusting dynamically with linked list nodes.
- Linked List Representation 🔗:

Represents big integers using a custom linked list, where each node stores a digit in reverse order for easy arithmetic operations.
- Modular Approach 🧩:

Divides the project into distinct modules for each arithmetic operation, ensuring clean, readable, and reusable code.
- Error Handling & Input Validation ⚠️:

Handles invalid input cases, displaying appropriate error messages for non-numeric or malformed numbers and unsupported operations.
- Scalability 📈:

Can handle integers of arbitrary size, scalable for a wide range of applications, depending on system memory.
- User Interface 🖥️:

Simple text-based menu for interacting with the program, providing options for arithmetic operations.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility 🌍:

Works on any platform that supports C and linked lists, without reliance on specific libraries or frameworks.
